## Class Logistics

- Class is from 9am to 5pm Eastern Time
- Class session are March 20, 22, 25 and 27
- There is a one-hour lunch from 12 to 1
- This hour is sacrosanct, this gives you time to schedule non-class activities like phone meetings etc
- There will be a 15-minute break roughly mid-morning and another roughly mid-afternoon

#### Materials

- All materials are in this repository and are available until April 25, 2024 at this link  [Materials Repository](https://github.com/ExgnosisClasses/Terraform-March2024)

- All materials are published under a creative commons or equivalent license that permits free sharing.

- We will be referring to the online Terraform documentation during class - links will be in the materials to the appropriate sections.

#### Lab Environments

- Because the course emphasizes using Terraform in the IBM Cloud, you will need to have an IBM Cloud account that you can use for the class.

- To illustrate the cross cloud platform capabilities, there will also be AWS versions of the labs that you can do instead of or in addition to the IBM labs.

- You will need to install the CLI tools for IBM Cloud, or the AWS CLI tools if you also want to use AWS. 

- Many of the demos will use AWS simply because they have less code and are easier to follow. These are often provided as alternative labs that you can do later on your own.

- You will need to install the Terraform executable on your machine.

- The full set-up process is covered in the first lab.

#### Terraform Certification

- This is not a certification class, however many of the topics covered are part of the certification syllabus.

- The last module of the course will review the certification syllabus and provide resources for further self study for certification.
