# 5. Terraform Variables

---


## Terraform Variables

Variables are used to replace hardcoded values, like the instance type, in Terraform code 

Variables are typed, like in a programming language, but default to string if a type is not explicitly defined

Variables can have an optional default value 

If a value for a variable is not provided, then the user is prompted to supply a value at the command line when `terraform plan` is run 

Variables are reference by using the syntax:
- `var.<variable-name>`
- An older deprecated syntax that might appear in legacy code is `${var.<variable-name>}`

---

## Defining Variables

In the following example (example-3 in the repository)

The `variables.tf` file defines three variables
- There is a default defined for the `ami_type`
- The default is used _only_ if the variable is not assigned a value anywhere 
- The default ensures that the user will not be prompted for a value at the command line 

```terraform
variable "ami_type" {
  description = "The ami type to be used for the VM"
  type        = string
  default     = "ami-0f403e3180720dd7e"
}

variable "inst_type" {
    description = "Instance type for the VM"
    type = string
}

variable "bucket_name" {
    description = "Name of the bucket to be created"
    type = string
}
```

The values for the variables are defined in the `terraform.tfvars` file

```terraform
ami_type = "ami-080e1f13689e07408"
inst_type = "t2.nano"
bucket_name = "fried-onion-snacks-9987"
```

---

## Using Variables

The hardcoded values for the arguments can now be replaced with variables

```terraform
resource "aws_instance" "my_vm" {
  instance_type = var.inst_type
  ami           = var.ami_type
  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
}
```

## Output Return Values

* The outputs now validate that the actual attributes of the EC2 were set by the variables

## Lab 2-2

* Please do Lab 2-2

Notes:

This lab has students replace hardcoded values with variables


---

## String Interpolation

* Any attribute or value can be embedded in a string by using `string interpolation`
    - The interpolation syntax is ${value} to insert "value" into string
- Non-string values are converted to a string for interpolation

![](../artwork/VarInterp1.png)

Notes:

Modifying the output to use string interpolation is demo 3

---
## Local Variables

* Just like in a programming language, we can define local variables that can be used within a module
    - Local variables cannot be referenced outside the module
    - Local variables are defined in a `locals` block
    - Local variable definitions can be split across more than one `locals` block
    - Local variables are referenced with the syntax `local.<name>`

![](../artwork/Locals1.png)

---
## Primitive Data Types

* Variables and locals are typed data
* There are three primitive data types
    - _string_: A Unicode string
    - _numeric_: Used for both integral and non-integral values (434 and 1.34)
    - _boolean_: `true` and `false`
* There are also complex data types like lists and maps which will be covered in a later module.

## Heredoc Strings

* Terraform haa "heredoc" string literal like , which allows multi-line strings to be expressed more clearly.
* A heredoc string consists of:
    - An opening sequence consisting of:
        - A heredoc marker (<< or <<- â€” two less-than signs, with an optional hyphen for indented heredocs)
        - A delimiter word of your own choosing
        - A line break
    - The contents of the string, which can span any number of lines
    - The delimiter word you chose, alone on its own line (with indentation allowed for indented heredocs)

![](../artwork/Heredoc.png)

Notes:

Example 2-5 demonstrates heredoc strings

---

## Reading Files

* Local variables _must_ be initialized when defined
    - We cannot set their value with a `terraform.tfvars` entry
* The alternative to hardcoding a local variable is to read its value from a file
    - This is generally done when the variable is used to provide some metadata like the ID of the person running the code
    - Or when the variable contains text like a start-up script
* We use the `file` command to read in the contents of a text file

Notes:

Example 2-6 demonstrates reading a file

---

## Lab 2-3

* Please do Lab 2-3

Notes:

This lab has students implement local variables and reading from a file

---

## Template Files

* Using files provides some flexibility, but often we want to customize the contents of the file using some terraform variables
* To provide this facility, Terraform has a _templatefile_ which
    -  Reads in file with "slots" defined using string interpolation syntax
    -  Supplies arguments to fill in the slots
* In the example below
    - The template file _document.txt_ has a "slot" for "myname" that can be filled in
    - _This code was modified by ${myname}_
    - A local variable called _developer_ used to fill in the slot

![](../artwork/templatefile1.png)

Notes:

Example 2-7 illustrates the use of a templatefile

---
## Rendered Template File

* When all the variables are inserted into the template string, the result is said to be rendered

* The rendered string can be output as shown below

## Lab 2-4

* Please do Lab 2-4

Notes:

This lab has students convert the file in the previous lab into a template file

---

## Data Filters

* Earlier, the _data_ construct was introduced as a way to find AWS resources
* A problem that has been sidestepped so far is that the aws_instance code is not portable across regions because the ami instance id's are unique to a region
* To resolve this, a data resource can be used get a specific ami id in a region
    - The problem is trying to find just the one wanted
* The solution is to list all the properties the ami template has and then filter each property to perserve only the ones we want
    - This is not an ad-hoc solution but requires a knowledge of the attributes of the resource to be filtered
    - _And_ a specification of which attribute we want to query on

Notes:

The code for this and in the screenshots on the next slide are example 2-8

## Multiple Providers

* So for, all the code examples have used a default provider, but we can specify another provider by using an alias.
* In this _providers.tf_, the default provider is AWS region _us-east-2_, but a second provider for _us-east-1_ can be set with the alias "Virginia"
* We could have also had any other providers, like an Azure provider as well

![](../artwork/providers1.png)

Notes:

This is example 2-9

---

## Using Multiple Providers

* For a Terraform resource, the _providers_ argument specifies which provider will manage the resource
    - In no provider is specified, the default provider is used
* In the example below, the EC2 instance "Ohio" is being created by the default provider while "Virginia" is being created by the us-east-1 provider

## Lab 2-5

* Please do lab 2-5
* This is a bit more challenging to end the module
